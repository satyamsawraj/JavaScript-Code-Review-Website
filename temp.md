❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){ return a + b;}
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ The function `sum` does not declare or define the variables `a` and `b`. This will lead to an error because
JavaScript will try to access variables that are not in the current scope.
* ❌ The function does not take any arguments, which limits its reusability. A well-defined function should accept inputs
to operate on.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:

* ✔ The function now accepts two arguments `a` and `b`.
* ✔ These arguments are used to perform the addition, making the function more flexible and reusable.
* ✔ The function is now properly defined to perform the intended operation of summing two numbers.
